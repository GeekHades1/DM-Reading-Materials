Data Mining Must to Read Materials

In this repository, I'll recommend many must reading materials to you.
It may be include the whole field of data mining, I'll try my best.

So, let me tell you how to use this repo.

In the branch of data mining, I'll set them to a title, and put some reading materials information below by it as a item. If each item has :white_check_mark: before it, just say you could find it's pdf in my corresponed sub-repo.

Okay, Let us beginning! Good luck!
